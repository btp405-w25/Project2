BTP405 Winter 2025: Project 2 (30% of the final grade)
Prof. Eden Burton, Prof. Hina Tariq
School of Computer Programming and Analysis
Seneca Polytechnic
Winter 2025
Due: Week of April 15
Instructions
Please read the instructions carefully and follow conventions discussed in class. Final work shall be
placed in your group repository.
This work will build on the product definition that your group developed for activity 3.
The product log you have created in that exercise will be used to run weekly sprints as per the
Agile/Scrum approach studied in this course. The goal at the end of the project is to have a working
prototype that can be demonstrated to relevant stakeholders.
Weekly Sprints - (45%)
Your team should assign roles to members in the group as defined in the Agile/Scrum approach to devel-
opment. Your instructor will act as an exteral stakeholder which provides feedback at the sprint review
meetings. They will approve items generated for the next sprint’s backlog.
The followng is a tentative schedule for the sprints (precise times will be determined by your section’s
and instructor’s schedule)
• sprint 1, week of March 25 (15%)
• sprint 2, week of April 1 (15%)
• sprint 3, week of April 8 (15%)
Members not present for the sprint meeting will not receive credit for that sprint.
Product (25%)
Your implementation will use a Python-based framework. Django and Flask are most common but
you are free to use a less known one if you wish.
The actual functionality delivered will differ by group, but all code written should be of “high quality”.
It shall be well documented using Python documentation standards. Unit testing should be included
and automated where possible. A deployment strategy must also be included.
Documentation (10%)
Architecture diagrams and other documentation from your Activity 3 may have to be modified depending
on the decisions made during the sprints. Extra documentation related to the implemenatation should
be added.
Presentation - (20%)
Group members will present progress (as of the final sprint) to the product stakeholder (in this case your
instructor) in a 10-15 minute presentation. It should summarize the work completed thus far, include
a live demonstration and provide thoughts/insights about future steps. This will take place during the
week of April 15.

Marking Criteria
Specific criteria may be added by your instructor, but the following shall be used as a guideline.
• has the Scrum approach to product development been followed throughout the project?
• functionality ...is the prototype functional at the end of each sprint? is it easily tested?..is it
easily deployable? does it have a reasonable amount of functionality implemented given the time
allocated?
• is the documentation sufficent so that external professionals (non-technical and technical) can
quickly access relevant information?
• does the project management software tool used accurately reflect the current status of the project?
